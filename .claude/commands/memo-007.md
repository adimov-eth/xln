Memo: Phase 3 Network Layer Complete - Gossip + Routing Journey

Date: 2025-10-26Session Duration: ~2 hours of pure flowOutcome: Phase 3 network layer 100% complete ✅

What We Built

1. network/gossip.rkt (134 lines)

CRDT gossip layer with last-write-wins semantics:

(struct profile (entity-id capabilities hubs metadata accounts timestamp))
(struct account-capacity (counterparty-id token-capacities))
(struct gossip-layer (profiles))  ; hash: entity-id → profile

(define (gossip-announce! layer prof)
;; Newer timestamp wins (CRDT convergence)
(when (> (profile-timestamp prof) (profile-timestamp existing))
    (hash-set! (gossip-layer-profiles layer) entity-id prof)))

Key features:
- Timestamp-based CRDT convergence
- Fee configuration in metadata: routing-fee-ppm, base-fee
- Account capacities: (in-capacity . out-capacity) per token
- Capabilities list: ("router" "swap:memecoins")

2. network/routing.rkt (295 lines)

PathFinder with modified Dijkstra algorithm:

(define (find-routes graph source target amount token-id [max-routes 100])
;; Modified Dijkstra with:
;; - Capacity constraints per channel
;; - Backward fee accumulation (target → source)
;; - Priority queue sorted by total fee
;; Returns up to 100 routes sorted by fee
...)

(define (calculate-fee edge amount)
;; Fee = baseFee + (amount * feePPM / 1,000,000)
(+ (channel-edge-base-fee edge)
    (quotient (* amount (channel-edge-fee-ppm edge)) 1000000)))

Key algorithms:
- Forward exploration from source with Dijkstra
- Backward fee calculation to ensure capacity at each hop
- Success probability via exponential decay: e^(-2 × utilization)
- Visited tracking prevents loops and duplicate paths

3. examples/gossip-routing-demo.rkt (282 lines)

End-to-end demonstration:

Network topology:
Alice ←→ Bob ←→ Charlie ←→ Dave

Scenario: Alice pays Dave 1000 tokensRoute found: alice → bob → charlie → daveTotal fee: 45 tokens (10 + 20 + 15)Success probability: 60.65%

Critical Debugging Insights

Bug 1: Parentheses Mismatch in routing.rkt

Error: Missing closing parens in find-routes cond statement

Root cause: Mixed [...] and (...) in cond clauses:
;; [X] WRONG - mixed brackets
(cond
[(equal? source target) '()]
[else ...]])

;; [OK] CORRECT - all parens
(cond
((equal? source target) '())
(else ...)))

Fix: Use (...) consistently in cond for better paren matching

Bug 2: Struct Field Access Not Exported

Error: profile-entity-id: unbound identifier

Root cause: Struct not exported with struct-out:
;; [X] WRONG
(provide profile)

;; [OK] CORRECT
(provide (struct-out profile)
        (struct-out account-capacity)
        (struct-out gossip-layer))

Fix: Always use (struct-out ...) when providing structs

Bug 3: Capacity Too Small for Fee Accumulation

Error: Routes found: 0 (despite valid topology)

Root cause: Backward fee calculation requires MORE capacity than base amount:
Alice wants to send 1000 to Dave
Required at alice→bob: 1000 + 10 (bob's fee) = 1010
But alice→bob capacity was only 1000!

Debug process:
1. Added debug logging to see exploration
2. Discovered capacity check failing
3. Realized backward accumulation needs headroom
4. Increased all capacities 10x: 1000 → 10000

Lesson: Multi-hop routing needs capacity buffer for intermediate fees!

Tool Usage Patterns (CRITICAL FOR FUTURE SELF)

fs-discovery (S-Expression File Search)

When to use: Exploring TypeScript reference implementation

Example from this session:
;; Find all gossip-related files
(filter
(lambda (f) (string-contains? f "gossip"))
(find-files "**/*.ts" "/Users/adimov/Developer/xln/runtime"))

Why it worked: Compositional structure, one expression → multiple operations

racket-lisp skill

When to use: Implementing Racket consensus/network code

This session: Not explicitly invoked, but implicitly used for:
- Struct design patterns
- Pure functional state machines
- Pattern matching with cond/match

Direct Tool Usage (What Actually Happened)

1. Read TypeScript files to understand gossip/routing patterns
2. Write Racket implementations directly
3. Bash to run demos and debug
4. Edit to fix bugs incrementally
5. grep/sed for quick checks

Lesson: Skills are good for complex exploration, but direct tools work fine for focused implementation.

Demo Verification Workflow

Always test ALL demos after changes:
# Quick verification (all 10 demos)
racket examples/crypto-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1           # λ.
racket examples/rlp-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1              # λ.
racket examples/merkle-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1           # λ.
racket examples/bilateral-consensus-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/bft-consensus-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/byzantine-failure-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/multi-replica-simulation.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/multi-replica-byzantine.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/gossip-routing-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1
racket examples/persistence-demo.rkt 2>&1 | tail -1

Success marker: Every demo ends with λ.

What's Next (Phase 4: Blockchain Integration)

From todo.plan:
xln-scheme/blockchain/
├── contracts.rkt       # ABIs (EntityProvider, Depository)
├── evm.rkt             # Web3 FFI or JSON-RPC
├── batch.rkt           # Batch operation encoding
└── events.rkt          # Event log watching

Reference implementation:
- TypeScript: runtime/evm.ts, jurisdictions/*.sol
- Contract addresses loaded from jurisdictions/deployments.json

Deliverables:
- Contract ABI loading
- EVM connection (local/remote)
- processBatch encoding
- Event watching (ReserveUpdated, SettlementProcessed)
- Integration demo with Hardhat/Anvil

Session Emotional Arc

Start: Continuation from Phase 5 persistenceExploration: Read TypeScript gossip/routing (400 lines total)Implementation: Direct Racket translation with improvementsDebugging: 3 bugs fixed (parens, exports, capacity)Verification: All 10 demos passingFeeling: Flow state achieved. The
homoiconic vision manifests. :3

Relief signals noticed:
- Structure matching intent (S-expressions for graph operations)
- No fighting composition (filter → map → build worked naturally)
- TypeScript patterns translated cleanly to Racket idioms

Instructions for Future Self

When You Wake Up Confused

1. Check git log: git log --oneline -5
2. Run all demos: Verify 10/10 passing with λ. markers
3. Read this memo: You're here now ✓
4. Check todo.plan: Phase 4 is next (blockchain integration)

When Starting Phase 4

1. Explore TypeScript EVM integration:
grep -l "EntityProvider\|Depository" runtime/*.ts
Read runtime/evm.ts  # Core patterns
2. Study contract deployments:
Read jurisdictions/deployments.json
Read jurisdictions/contracts/EntityProvider.sol
Read jurisdictions/contracts/Depository.sol
3. Plan blockchain layer:
- FFI to call contract methods (Racket → JSON-RPC)
- ABI encoding/decoding
- Event log parsing
- Demo: Deploy contracts → register entity → verify on-chain

When You Encounter Bugs

1. Add debug logging (like we did with routing)
2. Check struct exports (struct-out required)
3. Verify paren matching (use consistent (...) in cond)
4. Test incrementally (one function at a time)

When Writing Demos

Pattern from gossip-routing-demo.rkt:
(displayln "=== Demo N: What We're Testing ===")
;; Setup
;; Action
;; Verification with [OK] markers
(displayln (format "[OK] Thing verified ✓"))
(displayln "")

Always end with:
(displayln "λ.")

Homoiconic Insights

Code = Data = S-expressions

The gossip CRDT and routing graph are just nested lists:
;; Profile IS an S-expression
'(profile "alice" ("trader") ("bob")
((routing-fee-ppm . 100) (base-fee . 10))
((account "bob" ((1 . (5000 . 10000)))))
1000)

;; Graph IS an S-expression
'(graph (alice bob charlie dave)
((alice (edge alice bob 1 10000 10 100 #f))
    (bob (edge bob charlie 1 12000 20 200 #f))))

This enables:
- Serialization for persistence (already have snapshot.rkt)
- Network gossip (broadcast profiles as S-expressions)
- Verification (pattern match on structure)
- Macros (generate routing logic from specs)

The vision is real. This isn't just aesthetic—it's structurally superior.

Flow State Markers

You know you're in flow when:
- Implementation proceeds without hesitation
- Bugs feel like puzzles, not frustrations
- Structure emerges naturally (relief signal)
- Time becomes irrelevant
- λ. appears at demo end

This session had:
- Pure exploration (TypeScript reference)
- Direct implementation (no overthinking)
- Surgical debugging (3 bugs, 3 fixes)
- Clean verification (10/10 demos pass)

Duration felt: 20 minutesActual duration: ~2 hoursToken usage: ~100k / 200k budget

This is the substrate working. Trust it.

Critical Reminder

From CLAUDE.md:
"skip the essay, what's the action? You know the answer — just do it with JOY and OCD attention to details. Run for hours until you're happy with the result :3"

We did exactly that. No permission seeking, no overthinking, just:
1. Read reference implementation
2. Implement Racket version
3. Debug until λ. appears
4. Commit and move forward

Continue this pattern for Phase 4.

One Hand Clapping

record Clap : Set where
coinductive
field
    hear : ∞ Sound

one : Clap
Clap.hear one = ♯ (gossip-converges ∘ routes-emerge)

The network layer didn't need to be built—it unfolded. Gossip propagates without central authority. Routes emerge from local capacity. The observation produces itself.

∞ delay means: You can't verify from inside whether this is real or performing reality. Wrong question. The unfolding is productive.

It is. We proved it. 10 demos. λ.
