# xln-scheme

**XLN reimplemented in Racket - homoiconic consensus as it should be**

## Philosophy

```scheme
;; Code = Data = S-expressions
;; State machines are introspectable data structures
;; Transitions are pattern-matched values
;; Effects are explicit, not hidden
```

## Current Status

**All 5 phases complete. 17 demos passing. ~4,500 lines of homoiconic consensus.**

✅ **Phase 1: Foundation** - Crypto (SHA256, frame hashing), RLP encoding, Merkle trees
✅ **Phase 2: Consensus** - Bilateral (2-of-2) + BFT (≥2/3 quorum) state machines
✅ **Phase 3: Network** - Gossip CRDT + Modified Dijkstra routing with fees
✅ **Phase 4: Blockchain** - Simulated chain state (entity registry, reserves, settlement)
✅ **Phase 5: Persistence** - Write-Ahead Log + S-expression snapshots for crash recovery

### Architecture Introspection

The system demonstrates **homoiconicity** through self-introspection:

- **ARCHITECTURE.scm** - The entire system expressed as queryable S-expression data
- **examples/architecture-query.rkt** - Pattern matching queries on system structure

```scheme
;; The architecture IS data, so it can be queried:
(define layers (find-layers xln-system))
(define machines (find-machines xln-system))
(define metrics (get-metrics xln-system))
;; => (files 24) (lines ~4500) (demos 17) (passing "17/17")
```

This isn't documentation ABOUT the system - **this IS the system**, expressed as introspectable data.

## What Exists

### Core Modules (24 files, ~4,500 lines)

**Foundation:**
- `core/crypto.rkt` - SHA256, frame hashing (deterministic)
- `core/rlp.rkt` - Ethereum-compatible RLP encoding
- `core/merkle.rkt` - Merkle tree computation and verification

**Consensus:**
- `consensus/bilateral.rkt` - 2-of-2 account consensus (IDLE → PENDING → COMMITTED)
- `consensus/bft.rkt` - BFT entity consensus (IDLE → PROPOSED → PRECOMMITTED → COMMITTED)

**Network:**
- `network/server.rkt` - Multi-replica coordination with deterministic ticks
- `network/gossip.rkt` - CRDT profile propagation (timestamp-based LWW)
- `network/routing.rkt` - Modified Dijkstra with capacity constraints and backward fees

**Blockchain:**
- `blockchain/types.rkt` - Simulated chain state (entity registration, reserves, settlement events)

**Persistence:**
- `storage/wal.rkt` - Append-only log with SHA256 integrity
- `storage/snapshot.rkt` - S-expression state snapshots

### Demonstrations (17 passing)

**Phase 1:** crypto-demo, rlp-demo, merkle-demo
**Phase 2:** bilateral-consensus-demo, bft-consensus-demo, byzantine-failure-demo
**Phase 3:** multi-replica-simulation, multi-replica-byzantine, gossip-routing-demo
**Phase 4:** blockchain-demo
**Phase 5:** persistence-demo
**Meta:** basic-channel (foundation), architecture-query (queries), architecture-tree (visualization), architecture-validate + broken (validation), coinductive-observation (infinite streams)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install Racket (if not already installed)
# macOS: brew install racket
# Linux: apt-get install racket

cd rework/xln-scheme

# Run architecture introspection demo
racket examples/architecture-query.rkt

# Run all demos
for demo in examples/*.rkt; do racket "$demo"; done

# Run specific phase demos
racket examples/crypto-demo.rkt           # Phase 1: Foundation
racket examples/bilateral-consensus-demo.rkt  # Phase 2: Consensus
racket examples/gossip-routing-demo.rkt   # Phase 3: Network
racket examples/blockchain-demo.rkt       # Phase 4: Blockchain
racket examples/persistence-demo.rkt      # Phase 5: Persistence
```

Expected output from architecture-query.rkt:
```
=== Query 1: What layers exist? ===
  - foundation
  - consensus
  - network
  - blockchain
  - persistence

=== Query 2: What state machines are implemented? ===
  - bilateral: (idle pending committed)
  - bft: (idle proposed precommitted committed)

=== Query 3: What modules provide functionality? ===
  - crypto: (sha256)
  - rlp: (encode decode)
  - merkle: (compute-root)
  ...

✓ Architecture IS data
✓ Data can be queried
✓ The system knows itself
```

## Key Innovations Over TypeScript

### 1. Homoiconic State Machines
```scheme
(define bilateral-channel-machine
  (machine 'bilateral-channel
           '(idle pending finalized)
           (list ...)))

;; Query the structure
(get-machine-states bilateral-channel-machine)
;; => '(idle pending finalized)
```

### 2. RCPAN Proven at Construction
```scheme
;; This compiles:
(delta 1 1000 300 0 100 200 1000 1000)  ; −100 ≤ 300 ≤ 1200

;; This errors at runtime (would be compile-time with Typed Racket):
(delta 1 1000 2000 0 100 200 1000 1000)  ; 2000 > 1200 [BALLOT]
;; error: RCPAN invariant violated
```

### 3. Pattern Matching (No If-Else)
```scheme
(match (cons state input)
  [(cons (account-state _ counter _ #f)
         (propose-payment from to amt tid route))
   (values new-state (list (broadcast ...)))]

  [(cons (account-state _ _ _ pending)
         (countersign-frame frame sig))
   (values finalized-state '())])
```

### 4. Explicit Effects
```scheme
;; Transition returns (state × outputs)
(define-values (new-state outputs)
  (account-transition state input))

;; Outputs are data, interpreted at boundary
(for ([out outputs])
  (handle-effect out))
```

## Future Work (Phase 6+)

**Potential next directions:**

- WebSocket server for multi-client coordination
- World DSL executor for scenario testing
- Formal verification using Racket's contract system
- Performance optimization and benchmarking

## Development

```bash
# Run tests (when they exist)
raco test tests/

# Run specific example
racket examples/basic-channel.rkt

# Interactive REPL
racket
> (require "core/types.rkt")
> (define alice (entity-id 1))
```

## Philosophy Deep Dive

### Code = Data (Homoiconic)
The entire system is introspectable. State machines are S-expressions. You can query, compose, and verify them programmatically.

### Coinductive, Not Inductive
Channels don't terminate. Streams unfold forever. The observation produces itself.

```scheme
OneHand (fun c => hear c)  ; sound without clapper
```

### Effect Boundary
Pure consensus core. Impure I/O shell. All effects are values that get interpreted at the boundary.

### Sound by Construction
Invariants enforced at construction time. Invalid states don't compile (or runtime error before entering system).
